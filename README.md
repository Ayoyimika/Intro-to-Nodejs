# Intro-to-Nodejs


Monolithic architecture: Monolithic architecture is a software development pattern where an entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. In this pattern, all the components of the application, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, are tightly coupled and run on the same server or set of servers.

Microservices: Microservices is a software development approach where an application is broken down into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. Each service performs a single function, and communicates with other services using lightweight protocols such as RESTful APIs.

- I prefer microsercices architecture because each service perform a single function which isn't bulky

- Nodejs is not a multithreading language, it is a single-threaded language, meaning it executes code sequentially in a single thread. However, Node.js can handle multiple requests simultaneously using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle a high volume of requests efficiently.

REPL: REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive programming environment commonly used for prototyping, testing, and debugging code. In a REPL, the user enters code, which is evaluated by the system and the result is returned to the user. The user can then modify the code and repeat the process, creating a loop of code evaluation and modification.
